<p>Set within a year after the events of Batman Begins (2005), Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new District Attorney Harvey Dent successfully begin to round up the criminals that plague Gotham City, until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only as "The Joker" appears in Gotham, creating a new wave of chaos. Batman's struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to "confront everything he believes" and improve his technology to stop him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel Dawes.—Leon Lombardi</p>

<p>Set in 2001, somewhere in rural India, #LaapataaLadies is about the adventures of two young brides who get lost from the same train. The chaos that ensues is both funny and moving; and sparks an unexpected series of events that lead them into a journey of immense discovery; about themselves, womanhood and life itself.—Visual Junkies</p>
<li><h3>Baby's Day Out</h3></li>

<p>Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and is just about to appear in the social pages of the newspaper. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as his parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnapping him, they have a harder time keeping hold of him, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than them.—Murray Chapman</p>
