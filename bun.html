    <h1>The Bun!</h1>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Origins and Popularity: The modern burger bun was popularized in the early 20th century. While burgers themselves have a more extended history, the concept of a bun specifically designed for hamburgers became widespread after Walter Anderson, a co-founder of White Castle, introduced it in the 1920s. The soft, squishy buns provided the perfect vehicle for the patty, making it easier to eat.</p></li>
    <li><p>Types of Buns: Burger buns come in a variety of types beyond the classic white bun. There are whole wheat buns, brioche buns, pretzel buns, potato buns, and even gluten-free buns. Each type adds a unique flavor and texture to the burger experience, with brioche buns being known for their rich, buttery taste and pretzel buns for their chewy texture.</p></li>
<li><p>Toasted vs. Untoasted: Toasting a burger bun can significantly enhance the eating experience. Toasting not only adds a nice crunch but also creates a barrier that helps prevent the bun from becoming soggy from the burger's juices and condiments. Many burger aficionados consider this an essential step in burger preparation.</p></li>
